# Automation Workflow Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification describes a multi-stage approach to manage article publishing automation workflows. Instead of hardcoding automation logic, the system uses AI-powered workflow management that can adapt and evolve over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Specification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe automation workflows using markdown specifications so that workflows can be easily understood, modified, and generated by AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new automation workflow THEN a markdown specification SHALL be created describing the workflow steps
2. WHEN the specification is created THEN it SHALL include platform details, interaction steps, and validation rules
3. WHEN AI reads the specification THEN it SHALL be able to generate executable automation code
4. WHEN the specification changes THEN AI SHALL be able to update the automation code accordingly

### Requirement 2: AI Code Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI to generate automation code from workflow specifications so that I don't need to manually write repetitive automation logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow specification exists THEN AI SHALL generate TypeScript automation code
2. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL follow the existing BaseSpider pattern
3. WHEN multiple platforms need similar workflows THEN AI SHALL reuse common patterns
4. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL include proper error handling and logging

### Requirement 3: AI Workflow Guardian

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI to continuously monitor and maintain automation workflows so that broken automations are automatically fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automation code executes THEN AI SHALL monitor for failures and anomalies
2. WHEN a workflow fails THEN AI SHALL analyze the failure and attempt to fix the code
3. WHEN platform UIs change THEN AI SHALL detect selector changes and update the workflow
4. WHEN maintenance is performed THEN AI SHALL log all changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 4: Workflow Execution Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable workflow execution engine so that article publishing automation runs smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a publishing task is created THEN the workflow engine SHALL select the appropriate workflow
2. WHEN executing a workflow THEN the engine SHALL follow the specified steps in order
3. WHEN a step fails THEN the engine SHALL retry with fallback strategies
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the engine SHALL report success or failure with details

### Requirement 5: Workflow Versioning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflow specifications to be versioned so that I can track changes and roll back if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is created THEN it SHALL have a version number
2. WHEN a workflow is modified THEN the version number SHALL be incremented
3. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version
4. WHEN a workflow needs to be rolled back THEN previous versions SHALL be available
