### Workflow Management

ArtiPub uses a specification-driven approach for automation workflows. Workflow specifications are stored in `.kiro/specs/automation-workflow/`.

#### Creating a New Workflow

1. **Create Workflow Specification** (Markdown):
   ```markdown
   ### Platform Information
   - **Platform ID**: myplatform
   - **Base URL**: https://platform.com
   - **Editor URL**: https://platform.com/editor
   
   ### Workflow Steps
   
   #### Step 1: Navigate to Editor
   - Action: navigate
   - URL: https://platform.com/editor
   
   #### Step 2: Input Title
   - Action: fill
   - Selector: input[name="title"]
   - Value: {{article.title}}
   ```

2. **Load and Generate Code**:
   ```typescript
   import { workflowManagement } from '@/lib/workflow-management';
   
   // Load workflow from markdown
   const workflow = await workflowManagement.loadWorkflowFromMarkdown(
     'myplatform',
     markdownContent
   );
   
   // The system automatically generates TypeScript code
   console.log(workflow.generatedCode.code);
   ```

3. **Execute Workflow**:
   ```typescript
   const result = await workflowManagement.executeWorkflow('myplatform', {
     article: {
       id: '123',
       title: 'My Article',
       content: 'Article content...'
     },
     platform: 'myplatform'
   });
   ```

#### Workflow Maintenance

The AI Workflow Guardian automatically:
- Monitors workflow execution
- Detects when platform UIs change
- Updates selectors and recovery strategies
- Creates new workflow versions with fixes
- Logs all maintenance actions

#### Version Management

```typescript
// Get all versions for a platform
const versions = workflowManagement.getAllVersions('zhihu');

// Rollback to a previous version
workflowManagement.rollbackToVersion('zhihu', '1.0.0');

// Export workflow as markdown
const markdown = workflowManagement.exportWorkflowAsMarkdown('zhihu');
```

### Platform Integration
Configure platform-specific settings in `src/lib/types.ts`:

```typescript
export const PLATFORMS: Platform[] = [
  {
    id: 'zhihu',
    name: 'zhihu',
    displayName: 'Áü•‰πé',
    // ... configuration
  }
  // ... more platforms
];
```
