# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the current UI layout to address critical usability and visual design issues. The current implementation has problems with dark theme support (white backgrounds persisting), inconsistent border colors, and overly decorative components that detract from professional appearance and usability. The redesign will create a clean, professional interface that properly supports both light and dark themes with consistent styling throughout.
